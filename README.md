## Challenges

1. One major problem was to merge all of the files in a proper sequence.

2. We faced challenges with CSS, as few of the team members used Bootstrap and Material-UI and remaining few members unknowingly used the same name class which already existed in bootstrap, which created an unpredictable conflict in the styling Part.

3. The main challenge of ours was to run the whole project without rerendering or reloading.
